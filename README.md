# odin-recipes
First odin project assignment

I've had some experience with web dev, but it's nice to work a bit step-by-step and incrementally make a basic website.

Not a lot to show off here, just a basic page with links to other recipe pages.
Decent recipes that I found courtesy AllRecipes.com with images from Flickr.
